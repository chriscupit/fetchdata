Get React Data Exercise

This exercise is for the "Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN" course.  This project fetches, manipulates and renders data from an external API source.  I chose to keep Hacker News as the data source.  I added a css file for some styling and gave bootstrap a try for a card.  I would like to do more with bootstrap in the future as it seems to have many useful features.
